# ticket-viewer

Requirements: Java, Gradle

To install the application, clone this repository. It is easiest to run the application through an IDE like Intellij after importing it. 

To use the application, we run Main.java and enter the information as prompted, which asks for the subdomain, username, and API key for connecting to the Zendesk API.

The test cases pass with my credentials hard-coded and thus will not pass anymore, so they have the Disabled tag.
